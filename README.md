# 🔒 WTF-HideIt

## 📌 Description
This project allows you to securely hide files on the operating system, preventing them from being listed by common commands like `dir`. Ideal for keeping sensitive files out of sight of regular users.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Hides files so they do not appear in common directories.</br>
✅ Protection against listing via terminal or file explorer.</br>
✅ Supports Windows.


## ⚙️ How It Works
On **Windows**, the program uses system attributes to hide the file:
- `Hidden`: Makes the file invisible in the file explorer.
- `System`: Treats the file as a system file.
- `ReadOnly`: Prevents accidental modification.
